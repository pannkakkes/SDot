LBYARCH S13

This x86-to-C interface programming project serves to perform a dot product between vector A and vector B and place the result in sdot, the dot product of vectors A and B.

Input: Scalar variable n (integer) contains the length of the vector;  Vectors A and B are both double-precision float. Scalar sdot is a double-precision float.

Output: store the result in memory location sdot.  Display the result for all versions of the kernel.
